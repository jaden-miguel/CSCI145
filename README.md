CSCI145: Computer Programming &amp; Linear Data Structures

* Abstract data types, generics, access or pointer types, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, concurrent programming and linear data structures, including stacks, lists and queues. Programming is required in implementation of concepts.

On completion of this course, students will demonstrate:
* a basic understanding of the concepts of abstract data types and generics, and their implementation in a modern programming language;
* a basic understanding of access or pointer types and dynamic memory allocation, as implemented in a modern programming language;
* the ability to implement some basic algorithms using recursion;
* the use of a modern programming language for the implementation of abstract data types for linear data structures in the solution of problems;
* a basic understanding of the use of recursion in the definition and implementation of linear data structures, including stacks, lists and queues;
* the ability to create test cases for problems involving linear data structures.
